- Differentiate between a Singly Linked List and a list
- Identify the use cases for a **doubly linked list**
- Demonstrate common methods for a doubly linked list

- Become familiar with three types of tree data structures: **Tree**, **Binary Tree** and **Binary Search Tree**

## Introduction

In today's lecture, we will discuss about Data Structures and Algorithms in Python.

## Setup

1. Make sure that your current working directory (folder) contains a `Pipfile`, then run `pipenv install` in your terminal to install the packages in the `Pipfile` into the pipenv virtual environment.

2. Now that your `pipenv` virtual environment is ready to use, enter `pipenv shell` to enter the virtual environment.

3. Run `python lib/seed.py` to execute the code in the `seed.py` file to seed the database.

4. Run `python lib/cli.py` to execute the code in our `cli.py` file.
